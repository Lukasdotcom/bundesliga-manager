# League Support Level

Not every league has perfect support. This is the levels of support for all the leagues by default in the store.

- :1st_place_medal: is the top level of support so it is tested/used actively by me.
- :2nd_place_medal: is the second level of support which means it is not activly maintained/tested but will recieve bug fixes
- :3rd_place_medal: means that the league has no support anymore or is done.
- :new: means that the league is new and may have some unforeseen bugs.

| League     | Support           |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Bundesliga | :1st_place_medal: |
| EPL        | :2nd_place_medal: |
| Europe2024 | :new:             |
