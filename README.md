1. First download this file and edit the file to your preferences.

```
wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lukasdotcom/fantasy-manager/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml'

```
git clone -b stable https://github.com/lukasdotcom/fantasy-manager

2. Then copy the .env.sample file located in the docker folder. Edit the values like mentioned in the file and then put the contents into a file called .env.local in the root folder of the project
